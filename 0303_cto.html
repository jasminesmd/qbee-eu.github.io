The research interests of Dr. Al-Ars include:
<UL>
<LI>Analysis and development of multicore systems to accelerate big data applications such as bioinformatics
<LI>Methods for application domain analysis and mapping to appropriate multicore architectures (CPU, GPU, FPGA)
<LI>Design and optimization of interconnect solutions to improve system performance and relieve data transfer bottlenecks
<LI>Design, characterization and test process improvement for multicore systems using the abundant computational resources available in these systems
</UL>
