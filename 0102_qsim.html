<p>
Quantum computing is rapidly evolving especially after the discovery of several efficient quantum algorithms solving intractable classical problems such as Shor's factoring algorithm. However the realization of a large-scale physical quantum computer is very challenging and the number of qubits that are currently under development is still very low. In the absence of large size platforms, quantum computer simulation is critical for developing and testing quantum algorithms and investigating the different challenges facing the design of quantum computer hardware. What makes quantum computer simulation on classical computers particularly challenging are the memory and computational resource requirements. In this research theme, we introduce a universal quantum computer simulator, called QX, that takes as input a specially designed quantum assembly language, called QASM, and provides, through agressive optimisations, high simulation speeds and large number of qubits.
