<p>
Quantum computers hold the promise to be much more faster than any classical computer and solve problems that are intractable for even the most powerful classical machines. At Quantum Force, we started looking at applications that can benefit from the quantum phenomena. One of those applications is Quantum Genome Sequencing.

<p>
The research involves quantum accelerated genome sequence reconstruction. A first exploration in this direction was conducted by Aritra in his <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A4257310d-6d8b-4f5a-9fda-00cf8e081f0e">M.Sc. thesis</a> at Delft University of Technology.
